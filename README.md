# üå∏ KNN Classification on Iris Dataset

## Objective

The objective of this project is to implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification using the **Iris dataset**. The project covers the following tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, storing it in an SQLite database, normalizing the features, and encoding labels.
2. **Model Implementation**: Training a KNN model using the scikit-learn library, and experimenting with different values of K to identify the best model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizing decision boundaries.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizing the decision boundaries of the trained model using the first two features of the dataset.

This project helps understand **instance-based learning**, the role of **distance metrics**, and how KNN handles **multi-class classification** problems.

## üß† Key Concepts Covered

- **Instance-based learning**: KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions based on the closest training examples in the feature space.
- **Euclidean distance**: The primary distance metric used to measure similarity between data points in KNN.
- **Feature normalization**: Standardizing features to have zero mean and unit variance to ensure each feature contributes equally to the distance metric.
- **Multi-class classification**: KNN can handle problems where there are more than two classes.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing decision boundaries to understand how the model classifies different regions of the feature space.
